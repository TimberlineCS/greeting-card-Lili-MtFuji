# Greeting Card

## Project Overview
In this project you will apply JavaScript to the DOM to create a greeting card on an HTML page.  

## Objectives

- [ ] Create HTML elements
- [ ] Use JavaScript to manipulate HTML elements
- [ ] Use variables to manage data

## Specifications

Create a Greeting Card on an HTML page.  Your Greeting Card should include at least 10 different HTML elements.  You must use JavaScript (only) to create and manipulate your elements in such a way that they come together to clearly resemble a picture.   Your Greeting Card should include a variety of colors (at least 5), text, an image, and music. 

## Your Tasks

- [ ] Locate the index.html page.  Here you will create the basic elements for your page.  You must include at least 10 different elements. 
- [ ] Locate the App.js file.  Write code to manipulate the elements on your index.html page
- [ ] Include music with your GreetingCard.  Below is an example of how to do this, 

```
var au = new Audio("Music/AllIWantForChristmas.mp3");
au.controls = true;
document.body.appendChild(au);
```

- [ ] Document your code thoroughly as you go with comments
- [ ] Complete the required README using specified guidelines

## Overview

I made a Christmas card for my project. The card depicts a snowman standing in the middle of street with snow falling. The music "Merry Christmas Mr.Lawrence" makes the scene with melancholic vibes and makes you feel back in your old days.

## Compiling and Using

To open the card, right click the "index.html" and then click "Open conaining folder". When you press this, the folder will open and now you can see the "index.html". Double click that and my greetinf card will show up. 

## Discussion
 * What problems did you have? What went well? 
I started this project on Friday and I expected myself to finish this project in a day. However, when I faced the HTML, I noticed that I didn’t understand any of it. 
My problem was, start coding from scratch. So I first copy and pasted the code that was demonstrated in the google classroom (greeting project) and understand which code will make what happen. I didn’t know how to put image in front of the background. with some copy and paste process, I understand the background append”head” will make the image go over the background. 
 * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
I didn’t research it but it took me some time to insert image to the html.
Additionally, I had to play around for a while to understand how to position the image to where I wanted to put it. 
 * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
I often made a typo in my coding so that made some errors. 
 * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
I found it challenging to put snow fall GIFs in my project. When I first put the image, the image was too small so I had to adjust the size and also the location. 
 * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
I want to make my greeting card more fancier, such as adding more text and image more next time. I feel I only know the basic skill of coding, I would like to take some time to research and acquire new skills. 
 * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?
Now that I know how to code polygon(triangle,square), I would like to challenge myself by coding more complex shapes(stars and hearts).
